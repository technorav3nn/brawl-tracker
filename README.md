# Brawl Track

A simple website to look up your Brawl Stars profile and see some stats.
Meant to be a simple project to learn but also to be useful as well

Visit the website at [here.](https://brawl-tracker-pr-1-web.vercel.app/)

## To-do

- [ ] Player page
  - [x] General player stats page
  - [ ] Brawler page
    - [x] Show all owned brawlers for player
    - [ ] Show brawler stats for each brawler that player owns, as well as the equipped skin, star power, and gadget, and owned powers
    - [ ] Battlelog with a design similar to the one in-game
  - [ ] Misc
    - [ ] For logged in players when on their own profile, allow them to edit their background AND maybe theme? Could be difficult to add theme changer with Nuxt UI
- [ ] Club page
  - [ ] Show club stats with search with tag
  - [ ] Show club members and view profile link
  - [ ] View club mega pig (only can be done with Hpdexfox API, which could be down for a while or even forever)
  - [ ] More ideas?
- [ ] Cosmetics page
  - [ ] Show all brawlers and their skins
  - [ ] Sort skins by price, rarity, or brawler
- [ ] Community event page
  - [ ] Uses the content json file from https://brawlstars.inbox.supercell.com/ that you can find in Network tab in DevTools
  - [ ] Tracks exact community event numbers and percentages
- [ ] General
  - [ ] When Nuxt UI v3 comes out, update to it (this will be a long update and will be very annoying) https://ui3.nuxt.dev/getting-started
- [ ] Some sort of monetezation
  - [ ] A small one-time purchase like $0.30 USD just as a small donation, like a badge on the profile page or something
  - [ ] I'm never adding ads, I hate them
  - [ ] I also never want to make a lot of money of of this, I use alot of third party APIs and I don't want to make money off of them, I just want to make a cool project
- [ ] Add a changelog visibile on the frontend
- [ ] Add a privacy policy
- [ ] Add a terms of service
- [ ] Add a cookie policy
- [ ] Add a contact page
- [ ] Add a feedback page
- [ ] Add a FAQ page
